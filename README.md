# Student Study Activity Tracker App

This app is designed for school students to track their study activities, enabling them to set study goals for each subject, log the hours spent, mark completed lessons, and monitor their progress toward weekly targets. For example, a student studying ICT might set a goal of 3 hours per week. Each subject page features a circular progress bar to visually represent how much of the goal has been completed. Additionally, students can mark lessons they've studied.

The app color-codes lesson statuses based on how recently they were studied:

- Green: Studied recently (yesterday).
- Yellow: Studied within the last 2 weeks to 1 month.
- Red: Studied more than a month ago.

Students can also add friends from their classroom, and receive notifications when a friend achieves their weekly study goal for a subject.
